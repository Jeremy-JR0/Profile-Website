        <div class="about-text">
            <p>I‚Äôm a Master of Professional Engineering student, specialising in Software Engineering, with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science. With a strong 
                foundation in both theoretical principles and practical application, I‚Äôm passionate about building intelligent, efficient, and impactful technology solutions that 
                bridge the gap between innovation and usability.</p>
            <p>My technical interests span across web development, embedded systems, DevOps, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy working across the full development lifecycle‚Äîfrom 
                designing system architectures to writing clean, maintainable code, deploying scalable infrastructure, and applying intelligent automation to improve system 
                performance.</p>
            <p>What drives me most is the satisfaction of seeing an idea evolve into a fully realised product. There‚Äôs something incredibly rewarding about watching the pieces come 
                together‚Äîfrom the initial concept and planning to the final implementation and user interaction. I find real motivation in witnessing the tangible results of hard 
                work, knowing that the solutions I build can make a meaningful difference. Whether it's a responsive web app, a smart embedded system, or an automated deployment 
                pipeline, I take pride in seeing the finished product function seamlessly and deliver value to its users.</p>
            <p>Beyond technical skills, I bring a strong set of personal and professional qualities. I‚Äôm a:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creative thinker, always exploring innovative approaches to software challenges</li>
                <li>Natural leader, capable of guiding teams through collaboration, planning, and execution</li>
                <li>Effective communicator, able to translate technical concepts into clear, meaningful dialogue</li>
                <li>Dedicated team player, who values cooperation, respect, and shared success</li>
                <li>Detail-oriented professional, with strong organisational skills and a commitment to quality</li>
                <li>Adaptable learner, quick to pick up new technologies and respond to evolving project needs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I believe in the value of continuous learning, curiosity, and building solutions that not only function well but also solve real-world problems. I‚Äôm actively seeking 
                opportunities to contribute to impactful projects, grow alongside experienced teams, and continue pushing the boundaries of what software can do.</p>
