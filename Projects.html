        <div id="portfolioInfo">
            <p>This portfolio website serves as a centralized showcase of my coding projects, highlighting my skills in web development. Designed with a modern and interactive UI.
                It presents an organized collection of my work, including detailed project descriptions, source code links, and images where applicable. Built using modern web technologies such as HTML, Javascript and CSS, 
                the site not only demonstrates my technical expertise but also reflects my creativity and attention to user experience. This website is a work in progress, as when I develop new projects they will be added to this website. 
                There are plans to incorporate front-end framework such as react to add more to this project.

        <button class="button" onclick="buttonFunctionIOT()">Internet Of Thing (IOT) - Smart Plant Health Monitoring System</button>
        <div id="IOT">
            <p>This was a group project with 3 other people. We had the choice to make whatever IOT project we wanted and we chose to make a Smart Plant Health Monitoring System.
                The Smart Plant Health Monitoring System IoT Project is designed to help users maintain plant health by automating watering and lighting based on sensor data. It uses a Raspberry Pi connected to multiple sensors (humidity, temperature, light, soil moisture, and soil pH) to monitor plant conditions. The system integrates AWS IoT Core, DynamoDB, and API Gateway to store and transmit data to a web dashboard, allowing users to view real-time plant conditions.
                
                Key features include:
                <li>Automated Watering based on soil moisture levels.</li>
                <li>Automated Lighting based on light sensor readings.</li>
                <li>Manual Controls for watering and lighting via the dashboard.</li> 
                <li>Camera Integration to analyze plant health (detecting color changes or spots).</li>
                <li>Cloud-based Monitoring to access plant data remotely.</li>
                <li>Calibration Feature for the ultrasonic sensor to ensure accurate water level detection.</li>
            </p>

        <button class="button" onclick="buttonFunctionRetro()">Retro Console</button>
        <div id="Retro">
            <p>The Retro Console Project aimed to develop a fully interactive gaming console named Scorpio using LilyGO T-Display S3 devices. 
                The project involved designing and implementing hardware and software components, including wireless controllers, a VGA display, audio output, and multiple classic games. 
                The system supported both single-player and two-player modes, featuring four games: Pong, Snake, Flappy Bird, and a custom PvP Maze Hunter. Key Features:

                <li>Wireless Controllers: Implemented using ESP-NOW for real-time communication.</li>
                <li>VGA Output: 3-bit color VGA display with smooth graphics rendering.</li>
                <li>Audio System: PWM-based sound output with music and sound effects.</li>
                <li>Card Storage: Leaderboards for each game stored on an SD card.</li> 
                <li>Multiplayer Modes: Single-player and two-player options for enhanced gameplay.</li>

        <button class="button" onclick="buttonFunctionCapstone()">Capstone Project</button>
        <div id="Capstone">
            <p>The capstone project was a group project set buy a given client (a University staff member with project). The project was to take another project (Moving Target Defence (MTD)) and refactor some of the code and create a web application for it. 
                This is a web based application designed to help users learn about Moving Target Defence (MTD) techniques. This project used Vue.js for the front-end, python for the beck-end and docker to connect it all together. </p>

        <button class="button" onclick="buttonFunctionKR()">Knowledge Representation - UWA Book of Knowledge</button>
        <div id="KR">
            <p>The UWA Book of Knowledge project aimed to organize and represent data from the University of Western Australia's handbook using Knowledge Representation techniques. 
                The project utilized RDF (Resource Description Framework), SPARQL queries, SHACL constraints, and OWL ontologies to create a structured, flexible, and highly manipulable data model. This project was a team effort
                with another person in the class.</p>
