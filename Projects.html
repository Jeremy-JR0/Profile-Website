            <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>This portfolio website serves as a centralized showcase of my coding projects, highlighting my skills in web development. Designed with a modern and interactive UI.
                It presents an organized collection of my work, including detailed project descriptions, source code links, and images where applicable. Built using modern web technologies such as HTML, Javascript and CSS, 
                the site not only demonstrates my technical expertise but also reflects my creativity and attention to user experience. This website is a work in progress, as when I develop new projects they will be added to this website. 
                There are plans to incorporate front-end framework such as react to add more to this project.

            <h2>Internet Of Thing (IOT) - Smart Plant Health Monitoring System</h2>
            <p>This was a group project with 3 other people. We had the choice to make whatever IOT project we wanted and we chose to make a Smart Plant Health Monitoring System.
                The Smart Plant Health Monitoring System IoT Project is designed to help users maintain plant health by automating watering and lighting based on sensor data. It uses a Raspberry Pi connected to multiple sensors (humidity, temperature, light, soil moisture, and soil pH) to monitor plant conditions. The system integrates AWS IoT Core, DynamoDB, and API Gateway to store and transmit data to a web dashboard, allowing users to view real-time plant conditions.
                
                Key features include:
                <li>Automated Watering based on soil moisture levels.</li>
                <li>Automated Lighting based on light sensor readings.</li>
                <li>Manual Controls for watering and lighting via the dashboard.</li> 
                <li>Camera Integration to analyze plant health (detecting color changes or spots).</li>
                <li>Cloud-based Monitoring to access plant data remotely.</li>
                <li>Calibration Feature for the ultrasonic sensor to ensure accurate water level detection.</li>
