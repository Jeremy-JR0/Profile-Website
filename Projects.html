            <h2>Smart Plant Health Monitoring</h2>
            <p>A comprehensive IoT-based plant care system designed to monitor and maintain optimal plant health through automation and user interaction. Built around a Raspberry Pi, 
                the system collects real-time environmental data using multiple sensors and performs automated actions like watering and lighting. A custom-built web dashboard 
                provides live insights, historical trends, and manual control options, making the system suitable for both busy plant owners and remote monitoring.</p>
                <p> I co-developed this project alongside three other team members. My primary responsibilities included establishing cloud connectivity using AWS services, such as 
                    configuring AWS IoT Core, setting up AWS Lambda functions, managing data storage with DynamoDB, and integrating API Gateway for communication between the frontend 
                    and backend. I also handled much of the sensor integration and programming, as well as designing and implementing the layout for the web dashboard.

            <h2>Retro Console</h2>
            <p>A fully custom-built retro-style game console using LilyGO T-Display S3 microcontrollers and ESP-NOW for low-latency wireless multiplayer support. The system mimics 
                the feel of classic consoles, booting into a select screen where users can choose between multiple games, including single- and multiplayer options. One LilyGO device 
                serves as the main console connected to a display, while others act as wireless controllers. Game files are loaded dynamically from an SD card, and high scores are 
                saved to individual leaderboard files.
            </p>
            <p> I co-developed this project with a team of three other members. My key contributions included establishing the wireless communication between the console and two 
                controllers using ESP-NOW. I led the development of the games, adapting pre-existing code for compatibility with the console‚Äîsuch as Pong and Snake‚Äîand also 
                contributed to the creation of a custom "3D" shooter game. Additionally, I assisted with embedded systems work, including implementing SD card functionality for game 
                and leaderboard storage.

            <h2>Moving Target Defence</h2>
            <p>This capstone project is a web-based simulation tool designed to help users understand and visualize Moving Target Defence (MTD) techniques in cybersecurity. 
                Built on top of the existing MTDSimTime framework, the application allows users to configure, run, and analyze simulated attacks and defenses across up to five 
                graphs simultaneously. The simulator is fully containerized with Docker, making it easy to deploy locally or remotely. Users can customize parameters, save and 
                submit multiple simulation scenarios, and view results such as compromised nodes, attack techniques, and defense actions. The frontend provides interactive graph 
                visualizations and statistical breakdowns for each simulation. The application includes support for **advanced configuration** and has been structured for future 
                expansion with minimal backend adjustments. My contributions included collaborative development across both frontend and backend components, Docker 
                containerization for deployment, and documentation of system usage and simulation workflows.

                Developed in collaboration with one other team member, the project uses RDF, SPARQL, SHACL, and OWL ontologies to represent, validate, and reason 
                about relationships between university units and majors. As I co-develeped this project my main responsibilities were, designing and implementing the RDF structure
